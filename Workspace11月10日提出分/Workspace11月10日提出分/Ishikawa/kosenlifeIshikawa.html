        <p>
            　When I was in junior high school, I had a hard time deciding which high school to go to. 
            I decided on a technical college because the teacher at the music school I attended was a graduate 
            of a technical college. I became interested in technical colleges and gradually decided that I wanted
            to enter one in order to acquire knowledge and skills, so I decided to take the entrance examination. <br>
            　After entering the school, I was surprised at the time and speed of the classes. It was all I could do
            to concentrate in the unfamiliar 90-minute classes. However, I had several friends from junior high school, 
            so I was able to cooperate with them and make it through to the end. <br>
            　In club activities, I joined the soccer club and became more involved with my seniors.I also made friends 
            from other classes, which further expanded my friendships.<br>
            　I chose Information Systems as my major and am learning about programs, networks, and computer systems. 
            For my graduation research, I am studying in-vehicle anti-personnel detection systems. I am working hard 
            on my research every day.<br>
            　In club activities, I participated in a prefectural tournament and was able to score points 
            in the preliminary round. In the technical college tournament, we sometimes traveled outside the prefecture 
            and stayed overnight to play soccer.<br>
            　Although there were times when events were cancelled due to the coronavirus, sports competitions 
            are my fondest memories. Each class was divided into teams so that 2nd through 5th graders had to play 
            on the same team. it was difficult to win first place, but I was able to confide in the members year after year,
            and we enjoyed ourselves together whether we lost or won.<br>
            　To sum up my time at the college of technology in a few words, it was a <u><b><q>college of technology of exchange</q></b></u>. 
            The range of interaction was wide, and I spent time with my friends at all times. I was able to experience a variety 
            of things with people of all ages. I cannot talk about my life at the college of technology without mentioning my friends.<br>
