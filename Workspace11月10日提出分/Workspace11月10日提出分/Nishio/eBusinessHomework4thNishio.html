        <h3>What I learn?</h3>
        <p>I'm in the Department of Integrated Science and Technology
        Information Engineering Program.<br> 
        This course offers a variety of classes on information technology<br>
        For example...
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Information system development</li>
            <li>Algorithms and Data structure</li>
            <li>Control engineering </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            In the fifth grade, we learn about advanced specialized technologies. <br>
            I am particularly interested in a lecture on UML, which is a diagram used <br>
            in system development for design, and there are many different types of diagrams.<br>
            By learning this, we will learn about practical system development methods.
        </p>

        <h3>Graduation research</h3>
        <p>
            As my graduation research, I am developing a microcomputer-based paddy weeding robot in the <ruby>曽利<rt>そり</rt></ruby> laboratory.<br>
            Currently, I am developing software for the weeding robot for field experiments.<br>
            For example, reading measurements from touch sensors and gyro sensors, creating user interfaces.
        </p>

        <h3>Club activity</h3>
        <p>
            I am a member of the track and field team, specializing in short distance. <br>
            I have been practicing track and field for 8 years continuously since I was in junior high school.<br>
            At the NIT,Tsuyama, I participated in various competitions such as the prefectural competitions <br>
            and the National NIT competitions. <br>
            Currently, I have changed my field to long distance and am training to finish the <b>Okayama Marathon</b> in November 2023!
