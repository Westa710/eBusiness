            <h1>Foundry Services</h1>
            <p>
              Foundry Services involve semiconductor manufacturers providing their manufacturing processes and facilities to other companies or
              designers. Designers bring in their designs, utilizing the manufacturing process to produce semiconductor chips. This enables emerging
              companies or design houses to bring products to market without the need to own advanced manufacturing facilities.
